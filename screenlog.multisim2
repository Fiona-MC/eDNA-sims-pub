deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints".

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints".

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

The following object is masked from â€˜package:tidyrâ€™:

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints".

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change.

     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints".

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints".

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

[?25hdeldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

The following object is masked from â€˜package:tidyrâ€™:

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints".

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints".

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints".

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

This is INLA_22.05.07 built 2022-05-07 09:52:03 UTC.
 - See www.r-inla.org/contact-us for how to get help.
 - To enable PARDISO sparse library; see inla.pardiso()

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

Spam version 2.9-1 (2022-08-07) is loaded.
Type 'help( Spam)' or 'demo( spam)' for a short introduction 
and overview of this package.
Help for individual functions is also obtained by adding the
suffix '.spam' to the function name, e.g. 'help( chol.spam)'.

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints".

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change.

     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags")

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints".

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints".

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints".

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints".

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

[?25hdeldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has

     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.
