deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints".

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints".

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.

deldir 1.0-6      Nickname: "Mendacious Cosmonaut"

     The syntax of deldir() has had an important change. 
     The arguments have been re-ordered (the first three 
     are now "x, y, z") and some arguments have been 
     eliminated.  The handling of the z ("tags") 
     argument has been improved.
 
     The "dummy points" facility has been removed. 
     This facility was a historical artefact, was really 
     of no use to anyone, and had hung around much too 
     long.  Since there are no longer any "dummy points", 
     the structure of the value returned by deldir() has 
     changed slightly.  The arguments of plot.deldir() 
     have been adjusted accordingly; e.g. the character 
     string "wpoints" ("which points") has been 
     replaced by the logical scalar "showpoints". 
     The user should consult the help files.
